# UnityShaders
A collection of Unity Shaders I wrote and use for various things.

*ASDT2*:

 Great to use as a toon shader, made specifically for character and non-static, non-baked objects like avatars and weapons.

*ASDTLight*:

 Probably not as light as it sounds. It uses the Unity Surface shader interface, which sets up a lot of stuff automaticly. But it does make it more widely compatible.

*BASIC*:

 Designed to work for Quest or Go, this shader is meant for static, baked objects in the scene. It's meant to do minimal work and is great for drawing large amounts at a time with.

*The rest*:

 Just random stuff I made as experiments and for fun.

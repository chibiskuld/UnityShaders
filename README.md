# UnityShaders
A collection of Unity Shaders I wrote and use for various things.

*Avatar*:

 The toon shader that I use for just about everything.

*World*:

 Designed to work for Quest or Go, this shader is meant for static, baked objects in the scene. It's meant to do minimal work and is great for drawing large amounts at a time with.

*The rest*:

 Just random stuff I made as experiments and for fun.

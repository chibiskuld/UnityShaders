# Basics 2

This shader is designed to be a flexible shader for the Oculus Quest. It's meant to do things very minimalisticly, and have the ability to isolate features. The result produces a ton of shader variants, but this allows for maximum performance for your application to run smoothly on the quest.

### notes
- Eventually there will be an option for 'toon' added, Toon.cginc is yet to be implemented, but will eventually be added in.
- There is still no height mapping done yet.
